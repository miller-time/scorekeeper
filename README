================
Scorekeeper v0.1
================

Author: Russell Miller

Background
----------
This is a program I wrote a long time ago to keep score for a card game called
Hand and Foot. It's similar to Phase 10, which this program works perfect for.
Any other game where you would normally write scores on paper can utilize this
simple program.

Python
------
Originally I wrote this in Python and the text-only version of it runs from the command
line. It requires figlet, just to display the winner.

C++
---
Then, just for the sake of keeping up on my C++, I rewrote an object-oriented
version of Scorekeeper in C++. This is included in the 'cpp' directory. It runs
from the command line and is also text-only.

Qt
--
Right when I finished the C++ version of Scorekeeper, I knew I wanted to attach
that to a GUI with Qt. I had started working on a project for class at the time,
but didn't understand Qt's framework extremely well yet. Months later, I finally
finished the Qt version.

It is currently still in its early stages, at version 0.1.
