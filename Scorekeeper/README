This is the Qt version of Scorekeeper. 
I have compiled it on the systems I have available, and the binaries are
available at http://millertime.dnsdojo.com/downloads/
To get Qt, please visit http://qt.nokia.com/

This is an early stage (beta if you will) version of Scorekeeper in Qt. Many features
are swimming in my head, and are yet to be implemented.

If you are using Windows, please put the executable with the required .DLL files. I don't
yet know how to link against them (assuming that is possible). Those files can be found on
my download page (linked above).

This is one of my first GUI programs, and I'm still learning how Qt manages different aspects
of that, so bear with me.
